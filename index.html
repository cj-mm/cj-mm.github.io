                    Despite the difficulties I had with this subject, I definitely enjoy it. 
                    I like the thinking process while trying to figure out how different algorithms work.
                    It's like solving some puzzles and logics/riddles.

                    <b>Ethics - </b>
                    I just love those mind-boggling thoughts we had during our discussions.
                    I'm inlove with the idea and mystery of morality, consciousness, and/or 
                    the overall nature of reality. In fact, one of the course I consider before 
                    college is Philosophy.

                <p>
                    <b>Python - </b>
                    Simply because of its simplicity and stuffs you can do with it. 
                    This is also my first programming language.
